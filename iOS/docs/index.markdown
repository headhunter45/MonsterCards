[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/bbde5430-0b21-4b78-aa2f-32ce210fc578/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)

MonsterCards let you create and store monster statblocks for 5e compatible sytems. You can also import the files created by the popular 5e stat block generator at [https://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html](https://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html) You monster library is synced between your devices using iCloud. You'll need to create your own app ids, provisioning profiles, and iCloud storage if building from source. Due to the way iCloud works. Building from source will mean you sync data to a different iCloud container than using the official app. The app is currently in limited beta but will be available in the app store as soon as the collection and dashboard features are finished.

## Coming Soon

These are things we intend to complete before launching v1.0

* Collections - You will be able to group your saved monsters in collections. This is useful for grouping monsters by session/location/campaign.
* Dashboard - A set of monster thumbnails with vital stats that you can open to view full monster cards. This is useful for running encounters or having all the monsters you need for a session handy
* Native export/import format - We will be adding a file format for sharing monsters with other users so you can easily share creations to other users.
* [Android version](https://github.com/headhunter45/MonsterCards-Android)

## Wishlist 

These may never happen.

* Other import formats - We're taking suggestions
* Initiative Tracker - A basic initiative/hit point tracker.
* NFC - Put an NFC sticker on a mini and scan the mini to show it's card.
